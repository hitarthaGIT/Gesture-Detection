Gesture Detection using MediaPipe Hands

This code detects a specified hand gesture in a video using the MediaPipe Hands model and compares it with an input image representing the gesture.

Setup Instructions:
1. Install Python (if not already installed): https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Install required libraries by running:   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Place your video file (e.g., test_video.mp4) and the gesture image (e.g., gesture_image.jpg) in the project directory.

Usage:
1. Run the `gesture_detection.py` script.
2. Specify the path to your video file and gesture image when prompted.
3. The script will display the video with detected gestures annotated. Press 'q' to exit.

Note:
- Ensure that your video file contains recognizable hand gestures similar to the gesture represented in the input image.
- Adjust the threshold for gesture detection in the code as needed for optimal results.
